### Summary of the task

The activities to be completed in task 2 of the program are summarised as follows.

#### 1. Requirements gathering

To complete this task, we’ll first want to look at the task that we’ve been assigned and think about which available data sets may be useful to fulfill the requirements. We will first try to understand the data model and how the tables link together. 

####  2. Data cleaning

Before we begin to work with the relevant data sets, we’ll need to ensure that the data is clean and ready for analysis. Data cleaning is a common and very important task when working with data. This includes removing columns that have a high number of missing values, removing rows that have values which are erroneous, changing the data type of some values within a column and also removing columns which are not relevant to this task. Your end result should be a set of relevant data sets that are clean with each data set containing only the columns which are relevant to the completion of this task.


#### 3. Data modeling

Finally, use this knowledge to create a final data set containing all of the columns that you will need to complete the task. Based on which columns we think will be most useful, we may be required to merge tables together by using the Unique Keys within tables. You should spend some time modeling the data to create your final data set for this task.
